# Responsive Prototype Front End for Golden Shoes. 

## A 1 page Front End prototype to demonstrate benefits of respomsive design and demonstrate how this could curtail loss of online mobile revenue.

### Technology used.

#### CSS, HTML, Bootstrap (grid only), Fontawesome

### Concept

#### As a prototype it was my aim to show a website template that was legible on all screen sizes. This was achieved via a mix of media queries, and utilisation of scalable units.
